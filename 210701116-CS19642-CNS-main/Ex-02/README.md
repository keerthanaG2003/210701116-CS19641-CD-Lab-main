# Aim:
To write a python program implementing the Diffie Hellman algorithm.
# Algorithm:
### 1.P, G => available public keys. P, G => available public keys.
### 2.a is selected as a private key. b is selected as a private key.
### 3.Eq. to generate key: x=Ga modP. Eq. to generate key: y=Gb modP.
### 4.After exchanging keys, user1 receives key y. After exchanging keys, user2 receives key x.
