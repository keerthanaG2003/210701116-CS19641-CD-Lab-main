# Aim:
To write a python program implementing columnar transposition techniques.
# Algorithm:
### 1.The message is written out in rows of a fixed length, and then read out again column by column, and the columns are chosen in some scrambled order.
### 2.Width of the rows and the permutation of the columns are usually defined by a keyword.
### 3.The permutation is defined by the alphabetical order of the letters in the keyword. 
### 4.Any spare spaces are filled with nulls or left blank or placed by a character (Example: _).
### 5.Finally, the message is printed off in columns, in the order specified by the keyword.
