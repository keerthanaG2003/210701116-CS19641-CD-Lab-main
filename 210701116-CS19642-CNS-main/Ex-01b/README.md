Aim:
 	To write a python program implementing playfair cipher algorithm

# Algorithm:

### 1.Get the plaintext from the user
### 2.Get the key from the user
### 3.Plaintext is encrypted two letters at a time
### 4.If a pair is a repeated letter, insert filler like 'Xâ€™
### 5.If both letters fall in the same row, replace each with letter to right (wrapping back to start from end)
### 6.If both letters fall in the same column, replace each with the letter below it (again wrapping to top from bottom)
### 7.Otherwise each letter is replaced by the letter in the same row and in the column of the other letter of the pair.
