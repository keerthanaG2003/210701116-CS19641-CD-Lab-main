# Aim:
To write a python program implementing rail fence cipher algorithm
# Algorithm:
### 1.Get the plain text from the user
### 2.Set the key as 2 by default.
### 3.Arrange the plaintext in two rows in a zig-zag manner.
### 4.Derive the cipher text by adding the first row of arrangement with the second row of arrangement.
### 5.Get the original text by using the cipher text and arranging it in zigzag manner and repeat the same process.
