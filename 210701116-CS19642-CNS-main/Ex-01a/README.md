# Aim:
 To write a python program implementing caesar cipher algorithm

# Algorithm:
### 1.Get the plaintext from the user
### 2.Get the secret key from the user
### 3.If the character is uppercase take the ascii value of it and add with the key and subtract with original ascii value modulus with total number of characters.
### 4.If it is lowercase alphabet take its ascii value and do necessary operation modulus with total.
### 5.For digits and special characters take its ascii value and process it in its range.
### 6.Print the encrypted text.
### 7.Subtract the key from encrypted text to get original text.
